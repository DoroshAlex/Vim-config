*Description*

Do not pass untrusted user input to wddx_deserialize(). Unserialization can
result in code being loaded and executed due to object instantiation and
autoloading, and a malicious user may be able to exploit this. Use a safe,
standard data interchange format such as JSON (via |json_decode| and 
|json_encode|) if you need to pass serialized data to the user.
